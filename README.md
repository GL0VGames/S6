# Sneakily Slinging Slightly Sulfur-Smelling Smoke
Also known as S6.
## Premise
In this game, you're being paid to smoke people out of the movies. You are assigned a target, and you need to find their theater so you can throw in your smoke grenade. While this may sound easy, you don't get a detailed description of your target. You will need to sneak between theater entrances, peek in, and try to identify your target. At the same time, you'll need to avoid getting caught by security guards.
